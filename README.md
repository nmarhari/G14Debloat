# G14Debloat
Simple batch script for Zephyrus G14 laptops (developed for 2020 year model, Ryzen 9) to terminate and disable ASUS background processes.

To use the script, simply run the `.bat` script in administrator mode. (It should prompt for admin access if you do not run as administrator.) 
If there are any processes/services that you would like to add, I have added a template at the bottom of the script (replace `#` with appropriate application!)
